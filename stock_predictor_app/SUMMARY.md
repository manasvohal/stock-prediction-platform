# Stock Predictor Application - Project Summary

## Overview

The Stock Predictor Application is a full-stack web application that provides comprehensive stock analysis and prediction capabilities. It combines fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and sentiment analysis to generate investment recommendations for users.

## Architecture

The application follows a modern microservices architecture:

1. **Frontend**: React with TypeScript and Material UI
   - Component-based UI architecture
   - State management with React hooks
   - Interactive charts with Lightweight Charts
   - Responsive design for all devices

2. **Backend**: Python with FastAPI
   - RESTful API endpoints
   - Service-oriented architecture
   - Data processing services
   - Machine learning prediction model

3. **Database**: PostgreSQL
   - Stores stock data, analysis results, and predictions
   - Optimized for time-series data

4. **Containerization**: Docker and Docker Compose
   - Containerized services for easy deployment
   - Environment isolation
   - Simplified development workflow

## Features

### Stock Data
- Search for stocks by ticker or name
- View historical price data with interactive charts
- Access key stock information and metrics

### Fundamental Analysis
- Financial ratios (P/E, P/B, P/S, etc.)
- Growth metrics (revenue growth, earnings growth)
- Valuation metrics (market cap, enterprise value)
- Financial health indicators (debt-to-equity, current ratio)
- Dividend information

### Technical Analysis
- Moving averages (SMA, EMA)
- Technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Stochastic, etc.)
- Support and resistance levels
- Chart patterns detection
- Trend analysis

### Sentiment Analysis
- News sentiment analysis using FinBERT
- News article collection and processing
- Sentiment scoring and classification
- Social media sentiment integration

### Prediction Model
- Machine learning-based price prediction
- Multiple timeframe forecasts (1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months)
- Confidence scores for predictions
- Investment recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell)
- Risk assessment

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React 18
- TypeScript
- Material UI
- Vite
- Recharts and Lightweight Charts
- Axios for API calls

### Backend

- FastAPI
- SQLAlchemy ORM
- Pandas and NumPy for data processing
- yfinance for stock data
- Transformers (FinBERT) for sentiment analysis
- Scikit-learn for ML models

### Database
- PostgreSQL 14

### DevOps
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Shell scripts for automation

## Deployment

The application can be deployed using:

1. **Docker Compose**: For production and development environments
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Local Development**: For direct development without containers
   ```
   ./run.sh
   ```

## Future Enhancements

1. **User Authentication**: Add user accounts and personalized watchlists
2. **Portfolio Management**: Allow users to create and track portfolios
3. **Alerts System**: Notify users of significant events or prediction changes
4. **Advanced ML Models**: Implement more sophisticated prediction algorithms
5. **Real-time Data**: Add WebSocket support for real-time price updates
6. **Mobile App**: Develop companion mobile applications
